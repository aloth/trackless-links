# Privacy Policy for Trackless Links

**Effective Date:** August 10, 2025

At Trackless Links ("we," "us," or "our"), operated by Alexander Loth, we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information when you use our mobile application, Trackless Links ("App"). Our policy is simple because our App is designed from the ground up to protect your privacy.

We comply with applicable privacy laws and regulations including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).

## 1. Our Guiding Principle: We Don't Collect Your Data

Trackless Links is a privacy-first utility. We do not collect, store, track, or share any personal data or Browse activity from you. The App's core function is to clean URLs locally on your device, and we have no access to your web traffic or the links you click.

## 2. Information We Handle

We are committed to minimizing data handling. The only data the App interacts with is stored locally on your device.

### 2.1. Data You Provide and Store Locally
Any custom tracking parameters you add to the App's blocklist are **stored locally on your device** and are only accessed by the App to perform its function. We do not transmit this list to our servers, and we do not have access to it.

### 2.2. URL Processing
The Trackless Links Safari Extension processes URLs as you browse **entirely on your device**. The content of these URLs is never logged, stored, or transmitted off your device by us. The processing is ephemeral and happens in real-time within the secure, sandboxed environment provided by Apple for Safari Web Extensions.

## 3. How We Use Information

The only information the App uses is the list of tracking parameters (both default and custom) to perform its core function: cleaning URLs.

## 4. Sharing of Your Information

We do not share any data because we do not collect any personal data from you.

- **No Sale of Personal Data:** We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal data because we never have it in the first place.
- **No Third-Party Sharing:** Your Browse data and custom settings remain on your device and are never shared by us with any third parties.
- **Legal Requirements:** The only exception would be if we were required to disclose information by law, but as we do not collect or store user data, our ability to provide such data is virtually non-existent.

## 5. Data Security

We rely on the robust security measures built into Apple's iOS and Safari Web Extension frameworks. All processing occurs locally in a sandboxed environment, which is designed to protect your data from unauthorized access.

## 6. Children's Privacy

Our App is not intended for children under the age of 16 (or a higher age threshold if stipulated by local law). We do not knowingly collect any data from anyone, including children.

## 7. Your Privacy Rights

Your privacy rights are fully respected because your data stays with you.
- **Access, Correction, Deletion:** You have full control to view, add, and delete custom tracking parameters directly within the App. Deleting the App from your device will remove all its associated data.

## 8. Data Retention

The App's configuration data (your custom blocklist) is stored locally on your device and remains there until you delete it or uninstall the App.

## 9. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The updated policy will be posted in the App and/or on our website, and the "Effective Date" at the top will be revised. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.

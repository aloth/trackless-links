# Trackless Links: Complete Browsing Control for Safari

**Browse privately, skip unwanted sites, and take back control of your web experience.**

Trackless Links is a comprehensive Safari Extension that transforms how you browse. It automatically removes tracking parameters for privacy, lets you create powerful rules to redirect unwanted sites to better alternatives, and restores website functionality that sites often break or disable.

Crafted with a clean, modern design language, the entire experience feels light, powerful, and perfectly at home on all your devices.

## ✨ Key Features

Trackless Links is a complete toolkit for a better browsing experience, built on four powerful pillars.

### 🛡️ Core Privacy Engine

  * **Automatic Tracker Removal**: Silently strips tracking parameters (`utm_source`, `fbclid`, `gclid`, etc.) from URLs as you browse to protect your privacy.
  * **Customizable Blocklist**: Comes pre-loaded with common trackers and allows you to add your own custom rules.
  * **Privacy Statistics**: See exactly how many trackers have been blocked and how many redirects have been applied right from the main dashboard.

### 🔀 Power-User Redirects

  * **Skip Unwanted Sites**: Automatically redirect sites to better alternatives (e.g., `Reddit` → `old.reddit.com`, `Twitter` → `Nitter`, `YouTube` → `yewtu.be`).
  * **Advanced Rule Creation**: Build your own powerful redirect rules with full support for regular expressions (Regex) for ultimate control.
  * **Prioritize Your Rules**: Easily reorder your redirects with simple drag-and-drop to manage rule priority.

### ⚡ Enhanced Browsing Experience (Tweaks)

  * **Restore Website Functionality**: Re-enable text selection, copying, and context menus on sites that try to disable them.
  * **Remove Annoyances**: Block common annoyances like "Are you sure you want to leave?" dialogs and prevent sites from forcing links to open in a new tab.
  * **Better Media Controls**: Force native video/audio controls on websites, block autoplay, and set default playback speeds that persist across sites.
  * **Intelligent Dark Mode**: Apply dark mode to any website with smart color inversion that preserves images and media while transforming text and backgrounds for comfortable night browsing.

### 📦 Archive Search

* **One-Tap Archive Access**: Quickly find cached versions of web pages directly from Safari's extension popup or Share Sheet.
* **Multiple Archive Services**: Choose from Wayback Machine - or add other popular archive services.
* **Smart URL Processing**: Automatically removes query parameters for better archive match rates (configurable).
* **Find Lost Content**: View archived snapshots of hidden or deleted pages with ease.

### 📤 Seamless Workflow Integration

  * **Deep Share Sheet Integration**: Clean links or look them up in web archives directly from the Share Sheet in any app (iOS and iPadOS). Access your configured archive services from anywhere - Safari, Reddit, X, and more.
  * **Optional iCloud Sync**: Keep all your custom filters, redirects, and tweak settings perfectly in sync across all your Apple devices (Trackless Links Pro includes automatic sync between iPhone, iPad, and Mac).

## ✨ What Makes Trackless Links Different?

Most "privacy" extensions just block ads. Trackless Links does more – it cleans your URLs, redirects you away from tracking-heavy sites, and fixes broken website behaviors. All without sending a single byte of data to any server.

### 🛡️ Automatic Tracker Removal

Stop sharing links that expose your browsing habits.

- **Strips tracking parameters** like `utm_source`, `fbclid`, `gclid`, `mc_eid` from every URL
- **Pre-loaded blocklist** with 50+ common tracking codes
- **Add your own rules** for complete customization
- **Real-time statistics** show exactly how many trackers you've blocked

### 🔀 Smart URL Redirects

Skip annoying sites automatically.

- **Reddit → Old Reddit** – Escape the redesign
- **Twitter/X → XCancel** – Privacy-respecting alternative
- **YouTube → Invidious** – Ad-free viewing
- **Instagram → Imginn** – View without login
- **Google Maps → Apple Maps** – Native maps experience
- **20+ built-in redirects** focusing on privacy and speed
- **Create custom rules** with plain text or regex
- **Drag-and-drop priority** – Your rules, your order

### ⚡ Browser Tweaks That Actually Work

Restore the web functionality that sites try to break.

- **Force text selection** on sites that block copying
- **Enable right-click menus** everywhere
- **Block autoplay videos** across all sites
- **Force Picture-in-Picture** on any video
- **Remove "Are you sure you want to leave?" popups**
- **Apply dark mode** to any website with smart color inversion
- **Lock playback speed** so videos don't reset to 1x

### 🔍 Source Credibility — Know Before You Click

Get warned when visiting sites known for misinformation, fake news, or conspiracy theories.

- **Powered by [CRED-1](https://github.com/aloth/cred-1)** – Open, peer-reviewed dataset of 2,672 flagged domains
- **Tiered warning banners** – High risk (red), elevated (orange), moderate (yellow)
- **Dismiss or go back** – One tap to ignore per site or navigate to safety
- **100% on-device** – No browsing data sent anywhere
- **Off by default** – Enable when you're ready in the Credibility tab

### 📦 Web Archive Search

Find deleted or changed content instantly.

- **One-tap Wayback Machine access** from Safari toolbar
- **Multiple archive services** configurable
- **Smart URL cleaning** for better match rates
- **Works from Share Sheet** in any app

### 📤 Works Everywhere You Browse

# Trackless Links: URL Privacy for Safari
Browse cleaner and more privately. Trackless Links automatically removes tracking parameters from URLs.

Trackless Links is a simple, powerful Safari Extension for iOS that protects your privacy by cleaning URLs as you browse. It automatically detects and removes common tracking parameters (like utm_source, fbclid, and gclid) from links, resulting in shorter, cleaner URLs and preventing cross-site tracking. Take control of your digital footprint and share links with confidence.
